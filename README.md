# Dictionary

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create a dictionary that is able to add words, remove words, update definitions, define words, and count the number of words. The WordDef class creates WordDef objects and their methods. Each WordDef object contains a word and its definition as String objects. The main method declares an ArrayList of type WordDef named dictionary and manipulates it with WordDef methods. The program traverses dictionary in reverse during word removal to avoid shifting of subsequent elements. Thus, given the short list length from the user, linear search is a simple and efficient algorithm that will not miss any element; the best case time complexity is constant O(1), and the worst case is increasing time complexity O(n).

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Method 1: Download files and open with a Java IDE, preferably BlueJ. Method 2: Create a new Java project in an online Java IDE, preferably Replit. Copy and paste each .java file into the IDE.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Follow the prompts in the console while examining the code.
